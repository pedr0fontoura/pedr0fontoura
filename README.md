### Hi there 👋

My name is Pedro ~~aka snakewiz~~.

I'm a generalist game programmer, creating entertainment and immersive experiences on UGC gaming platforms.

Contributing to open-source projects, building tools to empower other developers, and writing technical articles are activities that I'm very enthusiastic about.

Because of my background in web development, I'm very proficient in TypeScript, Node.js, and React.

You may also know me for my contributions to the [Cfx](https://cfx.re/) / [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) community.
