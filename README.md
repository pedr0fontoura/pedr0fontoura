### Hi 👋

My name is Pedro.

I'm a generalist game programmer, currently working on creator platforms.

I'm experienced working in live-service games with multi-disciplinary teams and in fast-paced environments. I like contributing to open-source projects, building tools to empower other developers, and everything related to game development.

Languages: TypeScript, Lua, and C++.
