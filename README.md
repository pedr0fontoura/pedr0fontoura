### Hi 👋

My name is Pedro ~~aka snakewiz~~.

I'm a generalist game programmer, creating entertainment and immersive experiences for third-party multiplayer gaming platforms.

Contributing to open-source projects, building tools to empower other developers, and writing technical articles are activities that I'm very enthusiastic about.

Because of my background in web development, I'm proficient in TypeScript, Node.js, and React. I take advantage of those skills while creating game UIs. In addition, C# and Lua are languages I also use frequently for scripting.

You may also know me for my contributions to the [Cfx](https://cfx.re/) / [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) community.
