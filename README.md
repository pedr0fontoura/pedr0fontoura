### Hi there 👋

My name is Pedro ~~aka snakewiz~~.

I'm a full-stack software developer focused on games and related products. 

I'm passionate about solving game/product design problems with engineering solutions.

In addition to my work in game development, I am also interested in web technologies, open-source projects, and building tools to empower other developers. You may also know me for my contributions to the [Cfx](https://cfx.re/) / [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) community.
