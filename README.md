### Hi 👋

My name is Pedro.

I'm a generalist game programmer, currently building multiplayer team-thinking games.

I'm experienced working in Live Ops games with multi-disciplinary teams and in fast-paced environments. I like contributing to open-source projects, building tools to empower other developers, and everything related to game development.

Languages: TypeScript, Lua, C#, and C++.

You may also know me for my contributions to the [Cfx](https://cfx.re/) / [FiveM](https://fivem.net/) community.
